# Stochastic-model-of-VAT
In this repository we present the implementation of three stochastic models based on discrete Markov chains of adipocytes, macrophages and resident CD4+ T lymphocytes of human visceral adipose tissue. The code for each cell model is in the form of separate console applications implemented in C#. To use the console applications, we recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and changing the paths to store the output files.

This code was used to support the work presented in the article: "Molecular Tracking of Insulin Resistance and Inflammation Development on Visceral Adipose Tissue"
